# DEVLOG — Employment Simulator

- **Stood up the bare framework.** Studied the games-class framework lineage
  (`../HexPipes`, `../Random Exchange`, `../Server`). Decision: reuse the generic
  machinery, leave the domain layer as stubs for the dictated models ("bare
  framework only").
  - Framework: `gameengine.js`, `timer.js`, `util.js`, `graph.js`,
    `histogram.js`, `assetmanager.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`.
  - Params + data machinery: `parameters.js` (PARAMETERS + load/save UI),
    `datamanager.js` (sample → epoch → `socket.emit("insert")`), `main.js`
    (socket connect + run cycling), `runs.js`, `runner.js` (headless worker-thread
    batch runner → MongoDB). DB name: `employment_simulator`; points at the
    shared `../Server`, which is not copied.
  - Domain stubs awaiting Model 1: `agent.js`, `population.js`, `observer.js`.
  - All 14 JS files pass `node --check`. App loads and shows a placeholder
    Observer (tick / agent count / run name).
  - Recorded the architecture in `DEVPLAN.md`.
- Initialized the project: git repo, `README.md`, `DEVPLAN.md`, `DEVLOG.md`,
  `.gitignore`. Framed the project as a simulation of employment within a
  broader model of *exchanges* between agents.
- Next: Chris dictates Model 1 into `DEVPLAN.md`; we then implement it across the
  domain layer.
